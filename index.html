                <p class="section__text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                    applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs
                    native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to
                    describe the
                    appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span
                        class="section__text--italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span> . You
                    can learn more about
                    React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

                    interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most
                    of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve
                    as a refresher
                    course. </p>
                <p class="section__text section__text--margin-bottom">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind

                        components.</span> The rest of this
                    introduction to React uses cats in its
                    examples:
                    friendly,
                    approachable creatures that
                    need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                <p class="section__text section__text--margin-bottom"><span class="section__text--bold">+
                        JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                    JavaScript like so: <span class="section__text--background">
                        &#60;Text&#62; Hello, I am your
                        cat!&#60;&#8260;Text&#62;
                    </span>.
                </p>
                <p class="section__text section__text--margin-bottom">The React docs have <span
                        class="section__text--underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you
                    can refer to learn even more.
                    Because JSX is
                    JavaScript, you can
                    use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
                        class="section__text--background">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with
                    curly braces inside <span class="section__text--background"> &#60;Text&#62;</span></p>
                <p class="section__text section__text--margin-bottom"> <span class="section__text--bold">+
                        props.</span>Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
                <p class="section__text"> <span class="section__text--bold">+ state.</span>
                    While you can think of props as
                    arguments you use to configure how components render,
                    state is like a
                    component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or
                    that comes from user
                    interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                <p class="section__text section__text--margin-bottom">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user
                    to enter text. It has an
                    <span class="section__text--italic">onChangeText</span> prop that
                    takes
                    a function to
                    be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be
                    called
                    when the text is
                    submitted.
                </p>
                <p class="section__text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words
                    into a different
                    language.
                    In this new
                    language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
                    translated as "üçï
                    üçï".</p>
